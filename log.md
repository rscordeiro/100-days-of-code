### Day 3: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've written the PHP and succesfully it works! But we have to figure out how to display it properly. It keeps send us to a blank page.

**Thoughts** It's easier than I thought, beside the dificulty in display it right. I guess if I had studied PHP before it would be much more easier.
